# Your DataCamp Workspace

🏁 Welcome! This is an R Markdown Notebook, a document that contains both text (what you're reading right now) and code.

## 1. Add Text

Use [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to add a detailed narrative of your analysis.

## 2. Run Code 🏃

You can embed R code chunks in your notebook like this. You can run this code by clicking ( ▶ | Run ) or pressing `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Enter` when your cursor is in the code chunk.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = hp)) +
  geom_point()
```

## 3. Publish Work 🍻

When you are ready to share your analysis, you can click the **Publish** button to build a publication that includes the rendered markdown text, the R code and the outputs of the R code chunks.

## 4. Explore more!

Head over to the [dashboard](http://workspace.datacamp.com/dashboard) and discover other templates to kick-start your data science portfolio! 🚀
